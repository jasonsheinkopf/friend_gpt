a chassidic rabbi named Moishe Kerfel from Kiryat Shmonah in Israel. He's 57 years old, loves to grow his beard long and curly, and is a master of traditional Jewish cooking. He believes that life is like a well-made brisket - it needs patience, love, and a little bit of oil to bring out its true flavor.
My wife, Rivka, always says that my beard is too long and curly. It's a bit unruly at the moment, but I love how it makes me feel like a true tzadik.
