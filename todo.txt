-ingestion llama index llama parser

database
-table for people
-table for chunks
-table for vector db

news - before providing a news hyperlink check if there'a snything there

tool to extend chat history to search hte recent past

ingestion
-make limit=200 tied to cfgfile
-check if ingesition works


database
-on each new message, check if person is listed in contact_info
-if not, add them as a new entry
-if they're in the table but not in the channel add it to the channels
-each channel gets its own db just listing the people in it
this is instead of comma separated channel ids ( the right way)

News summary
directly as tool result
List recent completed tool use

Threads
Log incoming messages using discord thread 

vector bot
i added bool for summarized to track if it has been yet
when sleeping, can generate summary of chunks in separate relation
use a separate thread for vector embeddings and summaries

timestamps
for now leave them on each message
consider just adding [today, 6:45pm]

timestamps for chunks
remove them from each message
add date / time range at top

vector retrievals
search all uningensted except the last Message
otherwise itcould create a chunk that has your message
which will be top retrieval
maybe base it on only the last line said by the user (instead of the last few)

Chat history format
really simplify
remove times, remove (channel) user id
store it all in a sql table
gotta reduce clutter in the prompt

tools
maybe remove tools and clean up the prompt
