timestamps
-messages to the bot use discord timestamps
-messages from the bot use local timestamps
-sometimes bot replis 'before' it gets the message and it goes into the history backwards
-the reason to use discord timestamps for incoming is so that when we return from offline we can see messages
SOl'N only add messages that comes from discord...wait until bot's reply message routes through discord to Logged
