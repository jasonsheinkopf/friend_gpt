      "Summary: A list of celebrities allegedly connected to Sean Combs, also known as P Diddy, has gone viral on social media. The list includes names such as Leonardo Dicaprio, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, and Meghan Fox. Usher claimed his X account was hacked, but an old statement resurfaced where he said he witnessed 'wild things' when staying with Diddy. Other celebrities, including Pink and Megan Fox, have deleted their posts on X, sparking speculation about their connections to Diddy. Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering, with allegations that he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes. An officer who raided Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that 'the names...it's the same circle. It's the Epstein circle, the Harvey Weinstein circle.' Diddy's former protégé, Justin Bieber, is trying to stay focused on his personal life, having recently become a father.\n",

      "Summary: New allegations against Sean Combs, also known as Diddy, have emerged from his ex-girlfriend Kim Porter's diary, which was kept during their relationship. Porter's friends have shared 60 pages from the diary, which detail Combs' physical and emotional abuse, including a physical assault when Porter refused to participate in a certain sexual act. The diary also mentions Combs' 'parties,' which were actually orgies, and his 'vault' containing video tapes of his encounters with young men, including celebrities he had managed. Combs' attorney has responded by emphasizing that the charges against him are related to sex trafficking, not physical violence. The allegations are part of a larger investigation into Combs' behavior, which has sparked widespread concern and outrage.\n",

      "Summary: Rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs, also known as Puff Daddy, is on trial for multiple charges of conspiracy and sex trafficking. In a viral interview, Combs shared details about his famous parties, saying that celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, Ashton Kutcher, and Usher would attend. Combs described the atmosphere of his parties as 'perverted' and 'inhibiting', stating 'You gotta keep the girls there, you need locks on the doors. It's a little perverted. And you need heat, no air conditioning. That affects the alcohol and everyone feels more comfortable.' These revelations contrast with the serious allegations against him, including physical and emotional abuse of women and others, as well as manipulation through the distribution of narcotics. Combs is accused of leading a scheme to abuse women and others, and using his company to cover up the abuse and intimidate witnesses.\n",
