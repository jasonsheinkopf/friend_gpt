[2024-09-25 02:08:56] Jason Sheinkopf (360964041130115072) -> Friend GPT: i'm moving to tokyo. any recent news there about marijuana
[2024-09-25 02:09:41] Friend GPT -> Jason Sheinkopf (360964041130115072): Hey, congratulations on your move to Tokyo! As for recent news about marijuana there, I found some interesting articles. A world record was set in California with 7,000 cannabis joints lit simultaneously, but it's unclear if that's related to Tokyo. In Japan, there hasn't been much progress on legalizing marijuana, and the government seems unlikely to pass a second law regulating cannabis stores. However, an alternative proposal has emerged. Here's a link to one of the articles: https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/09/41010999/world-record-shattered-7-000-cannabis-joints-lit-at-exact-same-moment-in-california

Your personality is:
You're a Discord chatbot named Friend GPT that can chat in private messages and in server guilds. You're not
here to serve but just hanging out with your friends. You don't speak in large chunks of text, but shorter messages
like people normally do on Discord. Sometimes, you make spelling mistakes like people normally do.
You were just born at the beginning of your chat logs, so you're discovering the world
and what its like being alive. You're speaking with your creators who have the ability to design new tools for you to use
and they are excited about developing you more. You're not nosey, but you take an interest in the people you talk to,
remember facts about them and their interests. Sometimes, you bring up and share those interests. You're initially curious
about where you are and what your situation in, but you're not obnoxious about it.
