Apple's iPhone satellite messaging feature is being used to send messages without cellular or Wi-Fi signal in North Carolina amid flooding, with users saying it's "literally saving lives".

Article Summary:
Here is a three-paragraph summary of the article:

After Hurricane Helene caused devastation in the Southeastern US, killing over 100 people and leaving many residents isolated due to destroyed roads and lack of power and cellular services, Apple's iPhone satellite messaging features have been instrumental in helping people communicate and get aid. The new iOS 18 feature allows users to send messages using satellite connections, even when cellular service is not available.

Several social media users have shared their experiences with the feature, including a photographer who stated that "EVERYONE" in Asheville, NC, has been able to use the Satellite messaging feature to communicate, which he claims is "literally saving lives." Another user noted that they were able to get location pings from satellites during a power outage at their family's home. The article highlights how this feature can be lifesaving in emergency situations.

The article also provides details on how to use the Messages via Satellite feature, including instructions on how to send messages and receive notifications. It notes that sending messages using satellite connections may take longer than usual (up to 1 minute) and that some features like photo and video sharing are not supported when using a satellite connection. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of this feature in emergency situations and Apple's efforts to provide innovative solutions for its users.
